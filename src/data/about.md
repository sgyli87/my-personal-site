# Intro
I am currently a Master of Science student studying Computer Engineering at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I am also a Research Assistant at [The Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) directed by Prof Jon E Froehlich. I am working on researching and developing wearable AR devices to help Low-Vision people enjoy sports.

Previously, I graduated with a First Class Honours degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Liverpool](https://liverpool.ac.uk), where I worked with [Prof Vitaliy Kurlin](http://kurlin.org/) in his data science group. I was also a volunteer of the Buddy Progam and a tutor of Programming Workshops targeted at disadvantaged teenagers organized by [IntoUniversity](https://intouniversity.org/).

After graduation I took a GAP year and joined the industry. I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at HYC-SiscanTech, developing semiconductor-metrology system called [CD-SEM](https://www.hitachi-hightech.com/global/en/knowledge/semiconductor/room/manufacturing/cd-sem.html).
